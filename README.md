# SQL PORTFOLIO 


Hello, 

Thank you for viewing my SQL portfolio. Here is a collection of exercises I have done using SQL. Some of these examples are meant to showcase my skillset, as well as give a better insight into my personal life, such as my table of my favorite books I've read this year. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions - brittney2198@ucla.edu
