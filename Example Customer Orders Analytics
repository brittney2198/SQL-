-- For this example, I will be querying a database to analyze various statistics about customers and their purchase orders. 

# How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

# How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone';

# Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers 
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID;

# Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct orderID, Product, min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1; 

# What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, sum(quantity)* price  AS Total_Revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product; 

# Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, quantity, price, quantity * price AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"; 

# How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(BIT_DB.customers.acctnum)AS high_buyers , avg(quantity) * price FROM BIT_DB.customers 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
WHERE BIT_DB.FebSales.quantity > 2
GROUP BY acctnum;
