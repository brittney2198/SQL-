-- In this example, I will query interesting data from a large set of linked tables in a database. 

#Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != "USA"; 

#Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT  FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

#Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country, Invoiceid, Invoicedate, BillingCountry FROM chinook.customers c
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE c.Country = "Brazil"; 

#Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title like "%Sales%Agent%";

#Find a unique list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;

#Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 

SELECT c.FirstName as Customer_First, c.LastName AS Customer_Last, InvoiceId, CustomerId, BillingCountry, 
e. FirstName AS SalesRep_First, e.LastName AS SalesRep_Last
FROM chinook.invoices i
  JOIN chinook.customers c
  ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
  JOIN chinook.employees e
  ON c.SupportRepid = e.EmployeeId
ORDER BY InvoiceId;

#How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT * FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE InvoiceDate like "2009%"; 

#What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT sum(Total) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like "2009%";
